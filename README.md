# Using-Collaborative-Filtering-movie-recommender-system


A machine learning movie recommendation system using collaborative filtering.

Algorithm used:Collaborative Filtering.
 
The dataset was taken from kaggle and the copy of the dataset is there in this repo.

The recommendation system recommends the movies which have a higher correlation with the movie which we want to compare and the minimum number of reviews of people has been set to 100 for comparison.
I have used Python's inbuilt numpy and panda's library to use the the inbuilt functions.
I have also used Python's matplotlib and seaborn to do an analysis of my data.
Python's panda dataframe has been used to clean data. I have used two movies to compare with i.e. "Jurassic Park" and "Shawshank Redemption" and print all the movies which have similar correlation with it by using corr method.The code is present in repo.
